1.0  WHY AR

Why should you use AR?

  * AR is not copyrighted and can be distributed with your software

  * Complete source code is included

  * Compression is comparable with that of the major archivers such as ZIP,
     ARJ, and LHA.  Look at the following results:

    COMMAND  ZIP    31854  (PKZIP)
    COMMAND  ARJ    31902  (ARJ)
    COMMAND  SQZ    32023  (SQZ)
    COMMAND  LZH    32130  (LHA)
**  COMMAND  AR     32140  (AR)         **

  * Lousy documentation, but the program itself it good!

2.1  ADD

    The ADD command allows you to add files to an existing AR archive or to
create a new archive.  The syntax is:

AR A <arfile> <file> [<file>...]

where <file> is the files you want to add.  Note that if you try to add a
files which is already in the archive the file will be updated, not added
again.  If you wish to preserve both versions of the file, you must use a
different name.

2.2  EXTRACT

    There are two extract options, E and X.  The syntax for them is

AR [E/X] <arfile>

X will extract the files in the archive to the directory from which they
were stored.  E will extract all files in the archive to the current
directory, regardless of whether they came from different directories
originally.

2.3  REPLACE

    Use Replace when you wish to update files in the archive.  If you
specify a file with the R option which is not already in the file, nothing
will happen, so you can add new versions of all the files currently in an
archive by specifying *.* for the file specification.  The full syntax is:

AR R <arfile> <file> [<file>...]


2.4  DELETE

    This option will remove files from an AR archive.  The syntax is:

AR D <arfile> <file> [<file>...]


2.5  PRINT

    This option will print the contents of an AR archive to the screen.  It
can be redirected with the > operators.  The syntax is:

AR P <arfile> [<file>...]

The default is all files.

2.6  LIST

    This option will give a list of all the files stored in an AR archive.
The syntax is:

AR L <arfile> [<file>...]

The default is all files.

3.0  PROGRAMMING

    The complete C source for AR is provided.  For the files which I have
modified, I have included the original with a .BAK extention.  If you find
some bugs, just fix 'em and distribute a new version with your name on the
list of people who made modifications.  I don't think there are any bugs at
the present but I did not do extensive testing.
